# Internal DX11 Base

A fully universal internal DX11 base w/ ImGui

I used [this base](https://github.com/NightFyre/DX11-ImGui-Internal-Hook/tree/b44d74cbb20918c1b616190325ee49589b80cf36). as a Base and removed the Console and some other Stuff that i thought wasnt really important.

Also i added some Extra Stuff like a Font (RudaBold), a few Improvements and Custom Slider + Custom Checkbox!

I will keep working on it for some time because there is still something i wanna add but for now it works great!
